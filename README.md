# Covid-19-ICU-Patience-Analysis


The "COVID-19 ICU Patient Analysis" project is a focused examination of critical care data pertaining to patients affected by COVID-19. This study aims to analyze various features, including intubation status, presence of pneumonia, age, pregnancy status, diabetes, COPD, asthma, insurance coverage, hypertension, other pre-existing diseases, cardiovascular conditions, obesity, chronic renal issues, tobacco usage, and contact history with other COVID-19 cases.

Through a meticulous examination of these features, the project seeks to unravel significant patterns and correlations that can contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 cases in intensive care units (ICUs). The insights derived from this analysis can potentially aid healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in refining treatment protocols, resource allocation, and preventive measures. By leveraging statistical methods and machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide a valuable resource for the medical community to enhance decision-making and optimize care strategies for COVID-19 patients in ICU settings.
